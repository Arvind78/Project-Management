# Project Management Application

Welcome to the Project Management Application, a comprehensive tool designed to help you manage your projects effectively. This application is built using the MERN stack, with React.js and Ant Design for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. 

## Project Overview

Our Project Management Application provides a user-friendly interface for managing projects, allowing you to efficiently organize, track, and analyze your project data. Here are the key features of our application:

### User Authentication and Authorization

- **User Login and Authentication:** Users can securely log in to the application using their credentials. We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, ensuring user data safety.

### Project Management

- **Dynamic Project Counter:** The application dynamically counts the total number of projects, providing users with real-time project statistics.
- **Dynamic Project Chart:** Users can view a dynamic chart illustrating the ratio of open projects to closed projects, offering valuable insights into project statuses.
- **Project Filtering, Sorting, and Searching:** Users can filter, sort, and search for projects based on various parameters, making it easy to find specific projects within the system.

### Responsive Design

- **Fully Responsive:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
